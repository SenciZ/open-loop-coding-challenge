# OpenLoop coding challenge instructions.

## The Challenge

Build a React app that presents a user with a form, performs some simple validation, adds submissions to a list, and allows the user to remove submissions from said list.

## First, a few notes

Don't spend too much time on this - we know you're busy!
Be prepared to discuss details about your implementation. You'll have a chance to point out things you could have done differently, or things you were unsure of. Then we'll pair-program to add some features to it.
If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask us.
Don't worry too much about the styling, as we care more about how your submission functions.

## Requirements

Built with React. Feel free to use Create React App if you'd prefer, along with any other libraries (UI, forms, validation, etc.) that help you get the job done.
Form on the left, list of submissions on the right.
The first field in the form should auto-focus on page load and after each submission.
Form contains fields for: first name, last name, email, and note.
Each item in the submissions list should display: first name, last name, note, and email.
All form fields are required.
If a field has a validation error, display a status message below it, and indicate the error with a red border.
Ensure the `email` field value is the correct format.
Disable form submissions unless the form is valid.
Reset the form on submit.
Allow the user to remove submissions from the list.

## Submission

Put your submission in a git repo (on a git platform of your choice - GitHub, GitLab, etc.), and email us a link to it when you're finished. If it's not publicly accessible, please be sure to give us privileges so we can clone and run it.
